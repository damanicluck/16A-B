    "# Least Squares, PCA, SVD, Linearization Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSM EECS 16A/16B: Designing Information Devices and Systems I/II, Fall 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "As a note, this iPython notebook is completely optional for now... This is kind of a 16A and 16B crossover. In this iPython notebook, we'll be going over least squares, PCA (principal component analysis), SVD (singular value decomposition), and linearization. These methods are useful in data analysis and prediction! PCA and SVD will be shown after least squares, so if you're taking 16A right now, it's (probably) not in scope for you to know the rest of the topics. However, it is a good warmup or source of info for now if you plan on taking 16B as well.\n",

If you're clicking on this comment, congrats! idk what people will do with this, but hopefully its helpful. feel free to email me at damanicluck@berkeley.edu if you see this comment! :D. yk ngl i was a sophmore when i wrote this so like if it seems limited in anyway thats probably why i was like taking 70/61c and i was just deciding what upper divs to take\n",
