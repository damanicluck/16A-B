    "Hi! I'm Alex. Currently a lab assistant for EECS 16A. I'll be helping write this linear algebra introduction needed to understand the concepts described in this difficult but worthwile series of courses. Hope that I can make these classes seem a little bit less scary! Without further ado, let's get started!\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Mathematics is the art of reducing any problem to linear algebra\" - William Stein. \n",
    "Linear algebra is quite literally the study of vectors and their transformations. Why do we learn it in this course? It is one of the most important tools needed to effectively model real world processes from a numerical perspective. After all, this series literally has \"designing information\" in its name. Linear algebra gives us a strong mathematical base to give us the \"information\" to \"design\" (sorry not sorry). \n",

    "Not a minions reference, but a series of numbers\n",

    "### the Matrix (no pun intended)\n",
    "\n",
    "Combine a buncha vectors and you get the matrix\n",
